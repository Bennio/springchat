## Technologies 
### Java
Java is an object oriented programming language that can be used to develop software that it can
run on a variety of operating systems without modification. Moreover it is simple to use language,
with a large number of APIs, sufficient documentation and it is free.
### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is an open source relational database management system. It has been chosen because
it is supported by a variety of operating systems, it works efficiently with increasing load and has
many advanced features. Furthermore there are a number of command line, web and GUI front end
tools that can be used to manipulate databases.
### Hibernate
Hibernate is an open source object-relational mapping set of APIs for the Java language. The
purpose of Hibernate is to map the problem of mismatch between relational database systems and
object. The idea is to have a Java class for each table and manipulate the objects created by the
classes that map the tables. Moreover its thorough documentation and the fact that it is lightweight
make it a wise choice.
### Spring
Spring is a lightweight open source application framework that can be easily used with other
frameworks. It has a number of features that make it essential to use. There is a centralized
configuration file where Java beans can be created, transactions can be handled, without having to
manage each transaction separately and security can be managed. Data access objects can be used
on top of the Hibernate, which reduces errors and simplifies the development process. Testing
application code written using Spring is easier than other similar technologies.
